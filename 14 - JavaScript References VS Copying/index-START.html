    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let score = 100;
    let score2 = score;
    score = 200

    let name = 'Judith'
    let name2 = name;
    name = 'Judy'

    console.log((score != score2) === true)
    console.log((name != name2) === true)

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    let team = players;
    team[3] = 'Luka'

    console.log(team, players, (team === players) === true)

    // Updating the value of team changes the players array, too. Why? Because team only holds a reference -points to- to players.

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead! To prevent this from happening, we can create a new copy of the players array. Here are four ways of doing it:
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[3] = "Remiro"
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    const team4 = [...players]
    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    console.log(team2, players, (players !== team2) === true)
    console.log(team3, players, (players !== team3) === true)
    console.log(team4, players,(players !== team4) === true)
    console.log(team5, players,(players !== team5) === true)
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 70;

    console.log((captain.age == person.age) == true)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {'age': 90 })
    console.log(captain2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it. 

    // For a deep clone, you can do this: 
    const jay = {
      name: 'jay ma',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@jaymama',
        facebook: 'jay.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(jay);
    
    // Shallow copy
    const dev = Object.assign({}, jay);
    
    // "Deep" copy â€“ it's a hack, so watch out!
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(jay));
